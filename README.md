Improvements or suggestions to your shell experience.

bgrc is a set of improvements and suggestions from the simple defaults in your shell experience. Currently bash, vim and screen are improved. Feel free to investigate and cherry-pick or trying using `deploy_bgrc` to deploy the whole environment.

## bgscreenrc

`.screenrc`

## deploy_bgrc

Deploy all the above to a remote server. If deployed to an existing non-vanilla account it should be used with cauion as currently it will overwrite your vim and screen config. bashrc config is remained intact.
